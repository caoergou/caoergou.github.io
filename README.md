# Truer.ai

[中文版介绍](README-zh-CN.md)

Truer.ai is a website built with Hugo and GitHub Actions that collects the latest and most practical AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) applications that can be experienced firsthand.

## Why Truer.ai ?

AGI is changing lives and work, but many only theoretically understand it or lack knowledge of its practical use and benefit. Truer.ai addresses this by:

- Highlighting AGI's diversity and useful applications, not just recognition or autonomous vehicles.
- Spreading AGI knowledge and experience so people can apply it to work and problems.
- Stimulating AGI innovation and exploration across fields and in creating better products/services.

## Open and Welcoming

[Truer.ai](https://truer.ai) is open-source and open. Anyone interested in or experienced with AGI can:

- Contribute by submitting new AGI examples or participating in discussions.  
- Shape [Truer.ai](https://truer.ai) by providing feedback or suggestions.

And issues/pull requests are welcomed.

## Future Plans

Continuing relevance through regular content updates. Adding:

- [ ] Improved search, sorting and filtering to efficiently access information.
- [ ] A community for sharing AGI insights and experiences.
